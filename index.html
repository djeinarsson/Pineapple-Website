  <h2>Pineapples are wonderfully refreshing, sweet, tangy, and just <br>
    ever so slightly tart, making for wonderfully summery recipes!</h2>

    <h3>EASY PINEAPPLE LEMONADE</h3>
    <h4>4 STEPS TO FOLLOW:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li class="listheading">1. PREPARE THE PINEAPPLE.</li>
      <p>First, gather the flesh from the pineapple. If you want to save the pineapple to use as a serving<br>
        container,first slice off the top. Then scoop out the flesh. Alternatively, you can slice the<br>
        pineapple and use a knife to cut away the flesh, leaving any tough core behind but making sure to<br>
        collect all the juice. </p>
      <li class="listheading2">2. COMBINE THE INGREDIENTS.</li>
      <p>If you havenâ€™t already, then now is the time to prepare the simple syrup, too. If possible,<br>
        I recommend making this the day before (or at least an hour in advance) to allow it time to<br>
        cool before adding to your glass pitcher (to avoid cracking the glass). Then add the pineapple<br>
        flesh, simple syrup, ginger juice (or ginger syrup), lemon or lime, and a few mint leaves to a<br>
        large blender or a pitcher (if using an immersion blender). Then blend until a smooth,<br>
        puree-like consistency.</p>
      <li class="listheading3">3. ADD THE WATER.</li>
      <p>Finally, add the water (still, sparkling, or soda) and ice cubes (if you plan on serving and<br>
        enjoying it all immediately) and mix. You can first add half the water and taste test, then<br>
        adjust the ratio to your liking. Add a few more fresh mint leaves to garnish and then serve!</p>
      <li class="listheading4">4. DRINK IT & ENJOY!</li>
    </ol>
